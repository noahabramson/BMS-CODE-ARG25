- Multi devices
- Different SPI Bus
- Different SPI CS
- Mismatch datasheet and PyBMS API naming for 6830, 6832, 6834 REVA, 6836 REVA, 6837 REVA, 2950
- PEC10
- PEC15
- CCNT
- Different data for different devices in the daisychain
- Mixed daisychain gen 6 devices
- Mixed daisychain gen 7 devices
- Parser for single and multi devices

- Save state

### Untested

- Gen6-Z
- ADBMS6815
- ADBT1000
- ADBMS2960
- pybms2arduino converter
- timingcalculator
- Test_Instruments

### Errata

- In 2.0.5. pack level eis didn't save the data properly for multi lynx setups
- pyyaml in EIS Script was required but not installed
- The data folder in the EIS/Lynx_Module_EIS folder is not autogenerated. This can cause an error like: The system cannot find the path specified: 'data/xx_yy_zzzz'. This is fixed if you make this folder
- PyBMS API 2.0.4 and earlier versions do not work with Python 3.11.x. Please use Python 3.10.x. The installer will fail otherwise but might not show the error.
- Save State (for example XCH in 2960/2970) does not work with multi device multi data. For example, if you send XCH1, XCH0 to two Panthers, it will only show the values as if it was XCH0. The command however is executed correctly.

## 2.0.5. - June 2023

- Add pybms2arduino converter
- Add timing calculator
- Fix minor problems in scratchpads
- Fix FEIS calculation in EIS Scripts
- Add frequency list loader to EIS Scripts
- Add Saleae Logic Analyzer as Test_Equipment
- Patch plthelper (thanks Leon)
- Reorganize EIS Scripts (a lot of the support functions have moved outside the folder)
- Improve calibration algorithm for EIS
- Add Active load part
- Fix bug in SCON Asci that prevented timestamp from being added

- Auto detection of SDP-K1 does not work when the SDP-K1 is not shown as mbed in device manager. Manual overwrite (define com port) has works without problems

## 2.0.4. - April 2022

## 2.0.3. - January 2023
### Added

- Added alpha version device definition for ADBMS2960/ADBMS2970
- Add ADT7401
- Add include_cmd_objects option to print cmd objects if necessary
- Add option for showing data without raw_data
- Add option for memory pages on Panther (if you now select the page with XCH, PyBMS will keep track of it and present the right values (for example TMP1 or TMP2))
- Add option for memorizing gain settings on Tiger (if you set the OCxGC to 0/1, PyBMS will keep track of it and show the correct values)
    - This option does not work for multi device, multi data unfortunately.
- Add multiple scratchpads for Panther
- Add scratchpad for discharching on Lynx18
