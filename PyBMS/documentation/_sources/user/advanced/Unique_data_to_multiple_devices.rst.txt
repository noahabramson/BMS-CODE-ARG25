Unique data to multiple devices
===================================
In some cases, you want to control each device in the chain individual.
For example to only write a value to the second device in the chain.
This can be done relative easy. In the following example

.. code-block:: python
   :name: Define custom command
    # Make sure your board_list contains multiple devices
    board_list = [{'Device': ADBMS6830},{'Device': ADBMS6830},{'Device': ADBMS6830}]

    command_list = [
        {"command": "$SPI_WAKEUP$", "arguments": {"Wakeup Time": 400}},
        {"command": "SRST", "map_key": "val"},
        {"command": "$DELAY_MS$", "arguments": {"Delay": 10}},
        {"command": "$SPI_WAKEUP$", "arguments": {"Wakeup Time": 10}},
        # Instead of writing arguments, write board_list. Then define a list with dicts for each device
        {"command": "WRCFGA", "board_list": [{"REFON": True, 'FC': 0}, {"REFON": True, 'FC': 2}, {"REFON": True, 'FC': 5}]},
    ]

As you can see, you only need to use board_list instead of arguments.
