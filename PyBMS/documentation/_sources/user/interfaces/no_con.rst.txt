No Con Interface
===================================
If you just want to quickly test something, but you don't want to use an interface, you can use the
NoCon interface. This makes sure, you can run PyBMS without requiring hardware.

To use NoCon, simply replace the two components listed here
In case you don't care about the output, NoCon is also a possible interface.

replace:

.. code-block:: python
   :name: import_0

   from Engine.Interfaces.USB_TO_SPI_BYTE import USB_TO_SPI_BYTE

with:

.. code-block:: python
   :name: replace_0

   from Engine.Interfaces.NoCon import NoCon


And also replace

.. code-block:: python
   :name: import_1

   interface = USB_TO_SPI_BYTE('COM28', 115200, stdout=False)

with:

.. code-block:: python
   :name: replace_1

   interface = NoCon()

This of course means that there will be no communication. So the return values don't mean anything and should all have default values. However, you are still able to use scratchpads like normal to test for example the syntax. There is however some kind of output. The values that would normally been send to the SDP-K1, are now written to 'data.txt' (or whatever path you give up). The meaning of these values is as follows:
