USB to SPI Byte
===================================
USB to SPI Byte is the main interface of PyBMS API.
It converts the compiled command list to a table of SPI Data, amount of recieved and transmitted bytes and some additional information.
If you want to know exactly what is being send to the microcontroller, please read the user/interface/virtual_spi documentation.

This interfaces then uses a serial connection to communicate with the microcontroller.
This is most likely the SDP-K1.
However, this can also be a Teensy 4.1 or another type of microcontroller.
For the interface this is not relevant. The interface only has to know the com port and the baudrate.

You can find an example of this in most scratchpads. This is the code that sets up the interface:

.. code-block:: python
   :name: usb2spibyte

    interface = USB_TO_SPI_BYTE('COM23', 115200)

Just replace 'COM23' with the comport that is connected and you are good to go.

Errors
------------
In case PyBMS shows a Time Out error, this usually means there is a problem with the microcontroller.
In the case of the SDP-K1 there are a few possible issues.

- The red led is blinking or on. Please press the reset button, this fixes the issue
- In case the SDP-K1 shows up as two com ports, try both. Depending on the firmware it can show two com ports, but only one will work
- The SDP-K1 is in 1.8 volt mode, please set the jumper to 3.3 volt
- The SDP-K1 is not properly connected. The USB C version does not have the best connector
